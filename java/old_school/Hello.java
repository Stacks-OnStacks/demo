	// Every java program requires a Main Method Signature
	// This is the starting/entry point for every java program
	// Follows the EXACT SAME syntax
	
	// Here is the main method signature
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
	// public? Keyword that allows any and all class and programs to see this method
	// static? defines at the class level and allows it to view this main method
	// void? Return type, your main method is always void, as it should never return any value
	
	// main? is the method name, java specifically reads the file to find main
	// String[]? An array of Strings, Strings a a string of characters. [] this defines an array
	// args? This is the variable that is assigned to the added array of Strings
	
		System.out.println("Hello All you Wonderful People! You are absolutely killing it!"); // This prints out to console

		// " " - String literal, it's exactly definining a String without a constructor
		
	}
